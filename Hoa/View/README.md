# Hoa\View ![state](http://central.hoa-project.net/State/View)

This library defines a view interface: `Hoa\View\Viewable`.

A view is defined by 4 methods:

  * `getOutputStream`: where to write the view;
  * `getData`: what data we have;
  * `render`: to run the rendering;
  * `getRouter`: how do we locate resources and other documents.

That's all.
