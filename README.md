Hoa is a **modular**, **extensible** and **structured** set of PHP libraries.
Moreover, Hoa aims at being a bridge between industrial and research worlds.

# Hoa\Test ![state](http://central.hoa-project.net/State/Test)

This library provides tools to create and run tests for Hoa libraries.

In each library, a `Test/` directory contains test suites. So far, only unit
tests are supported. They are written with [atoum](http://atoum.org/).

## Quick usage

As a quick overview, we see how to execute, write and generate unit tests. Let
`Hoa\Foo` be a library.

### Execute tests

To execute some tests, we will use the `hoa test:run` command. We have several
options to select a set of tests:

  * `-f`/`--file` to select a single file,
  * `-d`/`--directory` to select a directory,
  * `-l`/`--library` to select all tests of a library,
  * `-a`/`--all` to select all tests of all libraries.

Most of the time, we will run all tests of a library, and then all the tests of
all libraries. Thus:

```sh
$ hoa test:run --library Foo
# do something
$ hoa test:run --all
```

### Manual unit tests

First, let's create the `Hoa/Foo/Test/Unit/Bar.php` file, that contains:

```php
namespace Hoa\Foo\Test\Unit {

class Bar extends \Hoa\Test\Unit\Suite {

    public function caseBaz ( ) {

        $this->integer(7 * 3 * 2)->isEqualTo(42);
    }
}

}
```

A class represents a test suite (that extends the `Hoa\Test\Unit\Suite` class).
A method represents a test case, where its name must be prefixed by `case`.

The `Hoa\Test` library enables the [Praspel extension for
atoum](http://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Contributions/Atoum/PraspelExtension).
Consequently, we have the `realdom`, `sample`, `sampleMany` etc. asserters to
automatically generate data.

### Automatically generate unit tests

Thanks to [Praspel](http://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Library/Praspel), we
are able to automatically generate test suites. Those test suites are compiled
into executable test suites written with atoum's API with the help of the
[Praspel extension for
atoum](http://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Contributions/Atoum/PraspelExtension).

Let `Hoa\Foo\Baz` be the following class:

```php
namespace Hoa\Foo {

class Baz {

    /**
     * @requires x: /foo.+ba[rz]/;
     * @ensures  \result: true;
     */
    public function qux ( ) {

        // …
    }
}

}
```

Then, to automatically generate a test suite, we will use the `hoa
test:generate` command. Thus:

```sh
$ hoa test:generate --class Hoa.Foo.Baz > Test/Praspel/Unit/Baz.php
```

`Hoa.Foo.Baz` is equivalent to `Hoa\\Foo\\Baz`, it avoids to escape
backslashes. The redirection (`>`) is needed for now. In a near future, it will
be removed and replaced by an automatic file creation. Then to execute this test
suite, nothing new:

```sh
$ hoa test:run --library Foo
```

or

```sh
$ hoa test:run --directory Test/Praspel/
```

to only run the test suite generated by the Praspel tools.

## Environment variables

  * `HOA_ATOUM_BIN`: this variable represents the path to the atoum binary,
  * `HOA_ATOUM_PRASPEL_EXTENSION`: this variable indicates the root of the
    `Atoum\PraspelExtension` library (do not forget the trailing `/`!); useful
    when Hoa is installed through the Central and not Composer.
